Cook for 2 to 3 hours or until the beans are cooked through and tender (note that cannelli beans will cook faster than navy beans, and older dry beans will take longer to cook than newer). Drain.
 SautÃÂÃÂ© onions with seasonings: : In a large thick-bottomed pot, sautÃÂÃÂ© onions in olive oil on medium high heat until tender, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin, cloves, and cayenne and cook a minute more. Add the green chiles and dried oregano. Add the minced jalapeÃÂÃÂ±o or serrano chile if using.
 Add chicken and stock, and simmer: : Add the chicken and chicken stock. Increase the heat to high, bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to low, cover and maintain the simmer for 20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.

Add all ingredients to the bowl of a food processor, fitted with the normal blade attachment. Pulse for about 10 seconds, or until the mixture reaches a crumbly texture (see photos above).
Remove the dough and form it into a ball with your hands, then place the dough on a lightly-floured cutting board. Knead the dough for 1-2 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. (If the dough seems too dry, add in an extra tablespoon or two of water. If the dough seems wet or sticky, just add in some extra flour, but you the dough to be fairly dry.)
Form the dough into a ball with your hands and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 1 day.
Roll out the pasta dough into your desired shape, either by hand or using a pasta maker (see notes above). Cook the pasta in a large pot of generously-salted boiling water until it is al dente, usually between 1-5 minutes depending on the thickness of your pasta. Drain and use immediately.
How To Make Pasta In A Stand Mixer:
Add all ingredients to the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with the dough hook. Knead the dough on low speed for 8-10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. (If the dough seems too dry, add in an extra tablespoon or two of water. If the dough seems wet or sticky, just add in some extra flour, but you the dough to be fairly dry.)
Form the dough into a ball with your hands and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 1 day.

How To Make Pasta By Hand:
Place the flour in a mound on a large cutting board. Use your fingers or a spoon to create a good-sized well in the middle of the flour mound (kind of like a volcano). Add the eggs in the center of the well. Sprinkle the salt and drizzle the olive oil on top of the eggs.
Use a fork to begin whisking the eggs until they are combined. Then begin to gradually whisk some of the surrounding flour into the egg mixture, adding more and more until the egg mixture is nice and thick. (If some eggs accidentally spill out, no worries, just use your hands or a bench scraper to pull them back in.) Use your hands to fold in the rest of the dough until it forms a loose ball. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic, sprinkling some extra flour on the cutting board if needed to prevent sticking or if they dough seems too wet or sticky. (That said, if the dough seems too dry, add in an extra tablespoon or two of water, but you want the dough to be fairly dry.)
